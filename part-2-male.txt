Caveats:
"1. 'Unreliable' appears for rates when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator. This is because the figure does not meet"
"the NCHS standard of reliability or precision. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Unreliable."
"2. Infant deaths are weighted so numbers may not exactly add to totals due to rounding. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#WeightFactors-Totals."
"3. Note that there may be slight differences in the number of infant deaths when comparing the Linked Birth / Death Records to"
"the other vital statistics. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Weight Factors."
"4. Beginning with 2020, bridged race is no longer available."
